Introduction
A hexadecimal number can be converted to octal by writing the binary equivalent of each hexadecimal digit in the same order. 
Converting the binary number obtained in the previous step to octal leads us to reach the overall result.
A binary number can be converted to octal by partitioning the binary digits in groups of three bits.

Objective of the system
In the number system, we come across four different types of the number system, i.e. hexadecimal, octal, decimal and binary.
The conversion of these numbers from one form to another is possible. To convert hexadecimal to octal numbers, we need to convert hexadecimal to its equivalent decimal number first and then decimal to octal.
Conversion of hexadecimal to octal cannot be done directly. Firstly we need to convert hexadecimal into its equivalent decimal number then decimal to octal.

Steps followed in conversion of hexadecimal to octal:

Step :Enter the Hexadecimal number in the input field

Step 2: Click on the “Enter” button to get the result

Step 3: The converted value will appear in the output field.

Hexadecimal number system:

Hexadecimal number system is a base 16 number system. It uses 16 symbols to represent all numbers i.e. 0123456789ABCDEF

Octal number system:

Octal number system is a base 8 number system. It uses 8 symbols to represent all numbers i.e. 01234567
